## About the Project
The **AI-Powered Hospital Management Platform** is a digital solution aimed at transforming healthcare access in Ethiopia. This platform enables patients to book appointments online, access their medical history securely, and interact with an AI assistant for help — all with just a few clicks. By leveraging **AI and free APIs**, the platform helps eliminate hospital overcrowding, reduces paperwork, and makes healthcare more accessible to people across Ethiopia.
